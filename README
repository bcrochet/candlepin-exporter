Import git://github.com/candlepin/candlepin.git into Eclipse
Create run configuration from Export class
Right-click this project in Eclipse, and select Export...
Select Runnable Jar
Check "Put dependencies in sub-directory beside jar"
Specify path and jar name
Export

You will end up with a jar file that you can then use in another project, and call "new Export().export()" to generate a new manifest.

This is not meant to be imported at this time. This is just a POC.
